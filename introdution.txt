Hi, my name is Lincoln Saha, and I am a Senior at Boston University.

Introducing Myself:
- I am from Queens, New York
- I like to rock climb
- I studied abroad in Singapore and traveled all over Southeast Asia last year

If I had to pick, I'd say that my favorite class was a Computing Systems class that I took last semester because I learned so much new and useful content, and it was interesting to see the intersection between between computing systems and AI
